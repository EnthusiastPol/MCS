            <p><strong>Food</strong><br><br>Food photography has experienced a remarkable growth in popularity in recent years thanks to social media. Previously, it was essentially a sub-genre of commercial work – advertisements, cookbooks, menus, and so on – but it’s becoming more a part of documentary photography today.</p>

            <p><strong>Commercial</strong><br><br>Commercial photography of people is anything intended to sell a product, especially advertisements and even stock photos. Commercial photographers often simply capture the products themselves; people are still used very frequently in advertising campaigns today. Usually, the goal of commercial photography is to create images that match the emotions and message the brand in question is trying to convey. These photographers need special skills in studio lighting and visualization to make the client’s plan a reality.</p>

            <p><strong>Interior</strong><br><br>From elegant shots of living rooms to close-ups of end tables, interior photography is a common feature of design magazines, real estate sites, and home rental platforms. You don’t have to be a professional photographer to take great indoor shots: All you need is the right equipment, patience, and creativity.</p>
